# FutureSports | Canberra FC

> **NOTE**\
> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Author

## Description
This react web application is a production level website prototype of a hypothetical football club "Canberra FC". This has no integrated backend however it does behave as though it is a fully functional website. This includes fully functional navigation, search bar, complex transitions, messages and responses to user input.

## Prerequisites
In order to execute this application Node.js must be installed locally. This can be downloaded from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) website.

API Keys:
1. Please create an [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3) API Key.
2. Subscribe to the One Call API 3.0
3. Please inject your API Key into `src\Components\Main\Homepage\Weather\Weather.js`

## How to Run
Navigate the the project directory `C:\..\..\futuresports>` and execute the following commands:

1. #### Run Local Test Version

    ```console
    npm start
    ```

    The application is accessible via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

    > **NOTE**\
    > The page will reload when you make changes. \
    > You may also see any lint errors in the console.

2. #### Run Tests

    ```console
    npm test
    ```

    The test results will be visible in the console.

    > **NOTE**\
    > The tests will be re-executed every time a change is made.


3. #### Run Build

    ```console
    npm run build
    ```

    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

3. #### Eject Build - Dangeraous

    ```console
    npm run eject
    ```

    If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

    Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

    You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

    > **NOTE**\
    > This operation is irreversible do not perform unless you are certain.
